# MakieTeX.jl

MakieTeX is a package that allows users to plot vector images - PDF, SVG, and TeX (which compiles to PDF) directly in Makie.  It exposes two approaches: the `teximg` recipe which plots any LaTeX-like object, and the `CachedDocument` API which allows users to plot documents directly as `scatter` markers.
